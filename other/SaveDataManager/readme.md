====================================

Manages persistence of user data in SRAM.

USAGE
-----

Add the following to the COMPONENTS variable in your project's `config.make` file to include this component:

	vuengine-components/other/SaveDataManager

You'll want to restore the previously saved settings for language and auto pause on startup. The recommended way is to call the function `SaveDataManager::initialize(SaveDataManager::restoreSettings());` from your game's main function before calling `Game::start(â€¦);`.

**Dependency**: you will need to include the component `vuengine-components/other/AutomaticPause` for recovering of the automatic pause status from SRAM to work.

See `source/config.h` for the available macros to modify the save manager's behaviour. Define the desired macro in your game's `config.h` file to override.

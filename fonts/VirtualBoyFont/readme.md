Usage
-----

Included are two versions of the font:

- `VirtualBoyFont` contains the most important 96 characters (punctuation character, numbers and letters)
- `VirtualBoyExtFont` additionally contains European characters

Be warned that the extended font uses up a large portion of character memory (1344 chars).
